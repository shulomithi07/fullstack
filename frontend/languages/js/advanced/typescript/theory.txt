So typescript is a superset of javascript
It basically converts javascript to a statically typed languange as originally javascript is dynamically typed languange
It can help in code completion
It also supports refactoring
It also supports Shorthand notations


DrawBacks
As typescript is not browser supported there is always 
a step of compilation of the ts code to convert it to javascript
This process is called as tranpilation

There should be discipline in coding

Typescript --> Medium to large projects
Javascript --> Simple projects


You can also annotate your typescript variable or function with type: any
But it contradicts the idea of typescript where we can handle the static type
It is not much preferred to use type any


Type alias
This is something like we create an object and use it as a predefined object
