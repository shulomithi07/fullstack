        <p>The browsers have limited themselves to not upgrade everytime 
            when there are alot of changes(with respect to new languages) 
            happen very now and then so they accept only three languages html css javascript
        </p>
        <p>CSS has multiple problems because the browsers are not accomadating the new languages in their system</p>
        <p>The main drawbacks are:</p>
        <p>We cannot use operators in css ex: 30px + 30px</p>
        <p>function concept: we cannot wrap a piece of code which is used multiple times in to a methods | function</p>
        <p>mixing</p>
        <p>partial</p>
        <p>include</p>
        <p>nesting</p>
        <p>parameters</p>
